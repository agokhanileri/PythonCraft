###
## Manual

<u>Requirements:</u>
* <u>Python</u>: version 3x (3.10 is used)\
* <u>Libraries</u>: Default libs used\
* <u>Inputs</u>: Placed under "./data"

###
Scripts are indented to be executed line-by-line execution.
* Printing ommited most of the time.
* Whitespaces are minimized for better focus and easier scrolling,
* Relevant lines are grouped together as much as possible.

###
<u>Study scripts:</u> Focus is comprehension and clarity
* LeetCode Q are also omitted since they are covered in [LeetCode](./LeetCode/Leetcode.md) section


###
<u>[ScriptPull.py](./ScriptPull.py):</u> Useful classes/methods to utilize in problems and projects.
  * to use classes: ``` from ScriptPull import MyClass ```
  * to use methods: ``` from ScriptPull import * ```

###
<u>Shortcuts used:</u> Although some are common sense, here we go.. <br>
<pre>Q = Question, Ops = Operations, DS = Data Structures, BT = Binary Tree or Binary Search Tree,
LL = Linked List, sol = solution, mod = modification, ans = answer, iter = iterate, concat =
concatenate, lib = library, func = function,
</pre>
